Thank you for downloading this pack and using my mod :)

This project has meant alot to me the past few months and it has been great to contribute such a beloved feature to the fabric community.

Feel free to join the discord for the mod @ https://discord.gg/rURmwrzUcz

The Entity Texture Features mod is required for this pack and is available on:
 - [CurseForge] @ https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-texture-features-fabric
 - [Modrinth]   @ https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures

This pack should also work fine with OptiFine but will not use all the features as ETF has additional features.
